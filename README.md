- **Tetris**: Thanks to Aerolab and Peter Coles for the auto tetris algo - https://github.com/Aerolab/blockrain.js
- **Xenakis**: A homage to Iannis Xenakis and Pierre Carr√©

- **Joypool**: Thanks to venkat24 for the FFT plots - https://github.com/venkat24/unknown-pleasures. Albeit the original image is not a Fourier analysis, but a ridgeline plot, also known as joy plot of radio emissions given out by a pulsar.
