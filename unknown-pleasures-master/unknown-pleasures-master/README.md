[Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) by Joy Division is one of the most iconic rock albums for it's incredible cover. Although its origin is actually a stacked plot of pulsar radio emissions from 1967, the artwork is famous for simply being so profound.

This program is a music visualizer in the style of Unknown Pleasures.

Due to copyright limitations, I obviously can't upload any commercial music, but the repo includes some royalty free tracks to try out. You'll have to download the project and run it locally to use your own files. I'll attempt to add an local browser upload feature.

The program works by decomposing the sound file into constituent frequencies with a [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform), and each wave is plot of the amplitude of a certain frequency varying with time.
